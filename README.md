# üéØ 100 Days CSS Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days CSS Challenge** repository!  
Here, I'm building **100 creative, mini CSS projects** ‚Äî one each day ‚Äî to sharpen my frontend skills, boost creativity, and master CSS animations, layouts, and UI design!

## üöÄ What is this Challenge?

This challenge is inspired by the original [100DaysCSS.com](https://100dayscss.com/). The goal is to build one CSS-only project every day for 100 days.  
No JavaScript. No frameworks. Just **HTML + CSS magic**! ‚ú®

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

Each day's work lives in its own folder:  
‚úÖ `day01` ‚Üí `day22` ‚Ä¶ `day100`  
Inside, you‚Äôll find a self-contained HTML + CSS project.
